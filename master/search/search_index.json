See the Concepts page for an explanation about the underlying concepts. See here for the list of currently available plugins. Xskipper supports adding your index types and specifying your own data skipping logic in order to enjoy data skipping over UDFs and a variety of data types. The pluggability is split between two main areas: Indexing Flow Interfaces for defining a new index - implementations of Index along with IndexFactory . Interface for specifying how to store the metadata in the metadatastore - implementations of MetaDataTranslator . Query Evaluation Flow Interfaces for defining how query expressions are mapped to abstract conditions on metadata - implementations of MetaDataFilter along with MetaDataFilterFactory . Interfaces for translating an abstract clause to a specific implementation according to the metadatastore - Implementations of ClauseTranslator . A new plugin can contain one or more of the above implementations. This architecture enables the registration of components using multiple packages. Using Existing Plugins \u00b6 To use a plugin, load the relevant implementations using the Registration module ( Scala , Python ). For example: Python Scala from xskipper import Registration Registration . addMetadataFilterFactory ( spark , 'io.xskipper.plugins.regex.filter.RegexValueListMetaDataFilterFactory' ) # Add IndexFactory Registration . addIndexFactory ( spark , 'io.xskipper.plugins.regex.index.RegexIndexFactory' ) # Add MetaDataTranslator Registration . addMetaDataTranslator ( spark , 'io.xskipper.plugins.regex.parquet.RegexValueListMetaDataTranslator' ) # Add ClauseTranslator Registration . addClauseTranslator ( spark , 'io.xskipper.plugins.regex.parquet.RegexValueListClauseTranslator' ) import io . xskipper . _ import io . xskipper . plugins . regex . filter . RegexValueListMetaDataFilterFactory import io . xskipper . plugins . regex . index . RegexIndexFactory import io . xskipper . plugins . regex . parquet .{ RegexValueListClauseTranslator , RegexValueListMetaDataTranslator } // registering the filter factories for user metadataFilters Registration . addIndexFactory ( RegexIndexFactory ) Registration . addMetadataFilterFactory ( RegexValueListMetaDataFilterFactory ) Registration . addClauseTranslator ( RegexValueListClauseTranslator ) Registration . addMetaDataTranslator ( RegexValueListMetaDataTranslator ) For the full list of plugins see here . Note When registering multiple plugins the order of registration for IndexFactory , MetadataTranslator , and ClauseTranslator matters. If two plugins define relevant translations or index creation for the same parameters the first one registered will be used. In general, you should avoid having multiple plugins that behave differently for the same indexes, metadata types or clauses. In the following sections we explain how to use the above interfaces in order to create a new plugin. The explanations will use examples from the sample plugin - xskipper-regex-plugin . The regex plugin enables indexing a text column by specifying a list of patterns and saving the matching substrings as a value list. For example, consider an application log dataset and one of its objects : application_name,log_line batch job,20/12/29 18:04:39 INFO FileSourceStrategy: Pruning directories with: batch job,20/12/29 18:04:40 INFO DAGScheduler: ResultStage 22 (collect at ParquetMetadataHandle.scala:324) finished in 0.011 s and the regex pattern \".* .* .* (.*): .*\" . When we index using the regex index, the metadata that will be saved is List(\"FileSourceStrategy\", \"DAGScheduler\") . The following query will benefit from this index and will skip the above object: SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE regexp_extract ( log_line , '.* .* .* (.*): .*' , 1 ) = 'MemoryStore' Indexing Flow \u00b6 Define the abstract metadata \u00b6 Implementation(s) of MetaDataType First you need to define the abstract metadata type that will be generated by the index. This type will hold the metadata in memory. For example, the MinMax index metadata type is a tuple of min and max values (see here ) For the Regex plugin, to store the unique list of matching substrings for a given pattern we use a HashSet of Strings (see here ). Define a new index \u00b6 Implementation(s) of Index along with IndexFactory Support for new indexes can be achieved by implementing a new class that implements the Index abstract class. A new index can use an existing MetaDataType or create its own MetaDataType along with a translation specification to the relevant metadatastore. The Index interface enables specifying one of two ways to collect the metadata: Tree Reduce - in this code path the index processes the object row by row and updates its internal state to reflect the update to the metadata. This mode enables running index creation in parallel for multiple indexes. Optimized - using this interface the index processes the entire object DataFrame and generates the metadata. For example, both the MinMaxIndex and the RegexValueListIndex . use the Tree Reduce mode to accumlate the list of unique matches. Along with the Index you need to define an IndexFactory - the IndexFactory specifies how to recreate the index instance when loading the index parameters from the metadatastore. For example, see RegexIndexFactory . Define translation for the metadata \u00b6 Implementation(s) of MetaDataTranslator Info Xskipper uses by default Parquet as the metadatastore. The Parquet metadatastore stores the metadata for the objects as rows in parquet files (for more details see here ). The API enables defining your own metadatastore. Here we focus on storing the metadata in the Parquet metadatastore. Therefore, the translations we cover here relate to the Parquet metadatastore. In order to store the abstract metadata defined above in the metadata store we have to specify a suitable translation which will map it to a valid representation for the metadatastore. For the Parquet metadatastore we have two options: Convert the metadata to an internal Spark Row which will later be saved to Parquet automatically, as Spark supports Parquet out of the box. For example, the MinMax index translates its values to a nested row with min and max values (see here ) Use a UDT to save the serialized abstract metadata. In some cases translating the metadata to Spark Row is not possible, therefore we save the metadata as a serialized binary. To do so you have 2 options: Use the default java serialization provided by the parquet metadata store. To do so you need to define the UDT and register it. For example, for bloom filter, we use the following definition to get the default java serialization: class BloomFilterMetaDataTypeUDT extends MetadataTypeUDT [ BloomFilterMetaData ] Then register the UDT to Spark using the ParquetMetadataStoreUDTRegistration object: ParquetMetadataStoreUDTRegistration . registerUDT ( classOf [ BloomFilterMetaData ]. getName , classOf [ BloomFilterMetaDataTypeUDT ]. getName ) Note that the bloom filter has the above definition built in so there is no need to register it. Note The UDT must be defined and registered in any program that uses the index. A recommended pattern is to define and register the UDT in the Clause Translator object where you also define the Clause Translation logic. This object will be loaded when registering the Clause Translator. Define your own UDT with custom serialization logic - similar to the above only this time you implement your own UDT. See the MetadataTypeUDT class for a reference. For the regex plugin we use the first option and translate the list of values to an array of values for storing in Parquet format (see here ). Query Evaluation Flow \u00b6 Define the abstract clause \u00b6 Implementations of Clause First, you need to define the abstract clause that will be created by the Filter. The Clause specifices an abstract condition which was deduced from the query and should operate on the metadata in order to determine the relevant objects. Each Clause is then translated to an explicit implementation according to the metadatastore type. For example, for the MinMax index we define a MinMaxClause which follows the logic that was presented here . For the Regex Plugin we use a Clause which holds the required matching patterns from the query (see here ). Define a new filter \u00b6 Implementation(s) of MetaDataFilter along with MetaDataFilterFactory The filter processes the query tree and labels it with clauses. In most cases we would like to map expressions to clauses. Therefore, xskipper provides a basic implementation of a filter called BaseMetadataFilter which processes the query tree automatically for AND and OR operators, leaving the user to handle only the remaining expressions. Implementations which extend the BaseMetadataFilter need only specify how expressions are mapped to clauses. For example, RegexValueListFilter and MinMaxFilter map the query expressions according to the logic presented here . A more advanced filter can process the entire tree by implementing the MetaDataFilter class without using the BaseMetadataFilter . Along with a Filter you need to define a MetadataFilterFactory . The MetadataFilterFactory specifies which filters should run given the available indexes. For example, see the RegexIndexFactory . Define translation for the clause \u00b6 Implementations of ClauseTranslator Info Xskipper uses Parquet as the metadatastore by default. The Parquet metadatastore stores the metadata for the objects as rows in parquet files (for more details see here ). Spark is used as the engine to run the abstract clauses on the metadata. The API enables defining your own metadatastore. Here we focus on the metadata in the Parquet metadatastore. Therefore, the translations are relevant to the Parquet metadatastore. In order to process a clause, the abstract clause defined above needs to be translated to a form that is executable by the metadatastore. For the Parquet metadatastore we have 2 options: Translate the Clause to a native Spark operation - this is useful when you have a built-in expression in Spark that can process the metadata. For example, for the MinMax index we use Spark\u2019s built-in inequality operators (>, <, >=, <=) to translate the abstract clause (see here ). Use a UDF that will process the metadata - this is useful when the metadata is saved by serializing the abstract metadata type or when there is no built-in operation that implements the logic needed in order to process the metadata. For example, for the BloomFilter index which we serializes its metadata, we use a UDF to check whether the given value exists in the metadata or not (see here ). For the Regex Plugin we translate the clause to use Spark's arrays_overlap and array_except functions in order to check if the values in the clause exist in the metadata (see here ).","title":"Using The Extensible API"},{"location":"api/creating-new-plugin/#using-the-extensible-api","text":"","title":"Using The Extensible API"},{"location":"api/creating-new-plugin/#intro","text":"Note This page explains the Extensible Data Skipping framework API.

This is achieved since the metadata itself is stored as a Parquet dataset, and thus PME can be used to encrypt it. This feature applies to all input formats, for example, a dataset stored in CSV format can have its metadata encrypted using PME. Note In the following sections, unless said otherwise, when referring to footers, columns etc., these are with respect to the metadata objects, and not the objects in the indexed dataset. Modularity \u00b6 Index Encryption is modular and is granular in the following way: Each Index can either be encrypted (with a per-index key granularity) or left plaintext. Footer + object name column + partition key values: The footer of the metadata object (in itself a Parquet file) contains (among other things): Schema of the metadata object, which reveals the types, parameters and column names for all indexes collected (for example, one can learn that a Bloom Filter Index is defined on column city with false-positive probability 0.1 ) Full path of the original dataset (or table name in case of a Hive Metastore table) The object name column stores the names of all indexed objects, and their modification timestamps at indexing time. The partition key values (for example, when Hive Style partitioning is used in the indexed dataset) are automatically stored by Xskipper, each virtual column in its own dedicated column. The footer + object name column + partition columns are encrypted using the same key - the \"footer key\", unless Plaintext footer is specified, in that case the object name column and the partition columns will still be encrypted, but the footer itself will be left plaintext (that is, the plaintext footer mode of PME will be activated). If at least 1 index is encrypted then the footer key must be set. This granularity enables usecases where different users have access to different subsets of the indexes in the metadata. In general, Xskipper will only try to access the indexes relevant for the query (based on the predicates in the WHERE clause) - and thus it's enough to only have access to the footer key and the keys for the relevant indexes. Thus, with an appropriate key selection, a single copy of the metadata can be used by different users, with each user having the keys for the indexes relevant to the columns they have access to in the data. Warning Xskipper doesn't have a fallback mechanism for index access, so even if the user has access to a subset of the indexes that is able to provide some skipping, if there are usable indexes for the query which are unaccessible - Xskipper will not be able to provide any skipping, the query will succeed but no skipping will happen - for example, say we have a MinMax on temp and ValueList on city but we can only access the footer key + the key for the MinMax and we run a query with WHERE city = 'PARIS' AND temp < 5 - even though we could use just the MinMax to get some skipping (though probably not all) - no skipping will occur. How to choose keys \u00b6 As mentioned before, if an index is not required for a query, Xskipper won't try to access it, and so the only factor for whether Xskipper tries to access an index is whether it's required for a query - and NOT whether it's accessible. thus, a good practice would be to make sure that if someone has access to a column, they will also have access to the indexes defined for that column (and of course the footer). Usage Flow \u00b6 Danger When using index encryption, whenever a \"key\" is configured in any Xskipper API, it's always the label - NEVER the key itself. In the following code examples we omit the PME configuration part as it varies between different implementations. A demonstrational KMS example can be found here Index Creation Flow \u00b6 Once the metadata is created, subsequent usages (both querying and refreshing) are all agnostic to the fact that this metadata is encrypted - so, except for the regular PME configurations (KMS, auth etc.) - everything remains the same. Sample 1 - Creating metadata with encrypted footer (default) \u00b6 Python Scala # configure footer key conf = dict ([( \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.footer.key\" , \"k1\" )]) xskipper . setConf ( conf ) # adding the indexes xskipper . indexBuilder () \\ . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" , \"k2\" ) \\ . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) \\ . build ( reader ) \\ . show ( 10 , False ) // set the footer key val conf = Map ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.footer.key\" -> \"k1\" ) xskipper . setConf ( conf ) xskipper . indexBuilder () // Add an encrypted MinMax index for temp . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" , \"k2\" ) // Add a plaintext ValueList index for city . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) . build ( reader ). show ( false ) Sample 2 - creating metadata with plaintext footer \u00b6 Python Scala # configure footer key conf = dict ([( \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.footer.key\" , \"k1\" ), ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.plaintext.footer\" , \"true\" )]) xskipper . setConf ( conf ) # adding the indexes xskipper . indexBuilder () \\ . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" , \"k2\" ) \\ . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) \\ . build ( reader ) \\ . show ( 10 , False ) // set the footer key val conf = Map ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.footer.key\" -> \"k1\" , \"io.xskipper.parquet.encryption.plaintext.footer\" -> \"true\" ) xskipper . setConf ( conf ) xskipper . indexBuilder () // Add an encrypted MinMax index for temp . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" , \"k2\" ) // Add a plaintext ValueList index for city . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) . build ( reader ). show ( false ) Query Flow \u00b6 When running Queries, there is no practical difference between encrypted metadata and non-encrypted metadata.

HIVE_DB_NAME : The name of the Hive database that contains the base path of the metadata in the database properties under the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation . For more information on how the metadata path is resolved see here . You should set the io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation in one of two ways: Setting base location for metadata (recommended) \u00b6 This configuration is useful for setting base location once for all datasets and should be used with the EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION or HIVE_DB_NAME types. The location of the metadata for each data set will be inferred automatically by combining the base path with a data set identifier. For example, setting EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION : Python Scala from xskipper import Xskipper # The base location to store all indexes # TODO: change to your index base location md_base_location = \"/tmp/metadata\" # Configuring the JVM wide parameters conf = dict ([ ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation\" , md_base_location ), ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type\" , \"EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION\" )]) Xskipper . setConf ( spark , conf ) import io . xskipper . _ // TODO: Change to your location val location = \"/tmp/metadata\" val conf = Map ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation\" -> location , \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type\" -> \"EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION\" ) // set JVM-wide parameters Xskipper . setConf ( conf ) Setting an explicit metadata location for an Xskipper instance \u00b6 This configuration is useful for setting a specific metadata location for a certain data set and should be used with the EXPLICIT_LOCATION or HIVE_TABLE_NAME type. You can also set it to EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION or HIVE_DB_NAME if you want to override the JVM defaults. For example setting an EXPLICIT_LOCATION for a specific xskipper instance: Python Scala xskipper = Xskipper ( spark_session , dataset_location ) # call set params to make sure it overwrites JVM wide config params = dict ([ ( 'io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation' , '<your metadata>' ), ( 'io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type' , 'EXPLICIT_LOCATION' )]) xskipper . setParams ( params ) val xskipper = new Xskipper ( spark , dataset_location ) // call set params to make sure it overwrites JVM wide config val params = Map ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation\" -> \"<your metadata>\" , \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type\" -> \"EXPLICIT_LOCATION\" ) xskipper . setParams ( params ) Note that when setting the type to HIVE_TABLE_NAME you should first set the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation in the table properties to point to the metadata location. You can the set the metadata location for hive table manually using the following DDL: ALTER TABLE myDb . myTable SET TBLPROPERTIES ( 'io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation' = '/location/of/metadata' ) If the location does not exist in the Hive table, xskipper will try to look up the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation in the table's database and treat it as a base path location. When using HIVE_TABLE_NAME as the location type once indexing is done the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation is set in the table properties. (in case a fallback to the database base path occured then the resolved path from using the database metadata location as base path is stored in the table properties) Metadata path resolving \u00b6 The following explains how the metadata path is resolved: During Indexing the metadata location is inferred according to the parameters parameters io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation and io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type which are set on the xskipper instance. These parameters are the default JVM wide parameters unless set differently for the given instance. During query run time, the metadata location is inferred according to the following If there is an active xskipper instance in the JVM for the dataset/table use it's metadata configuration. Otherwise: For Datasets: Look up the parameters io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation and io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type in the JVM wide configuration in order to infer the metadata location. For Hive tables (with partitions 1 ): If the table contains the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation use it as the metadata location. If not, look up the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation in the table's database and treat it as a base path location.

Theoretically it is possible to create a parquet file in which our metadata indicates an encryption config completely different than the one with which it's actually encrypted. we should avoid that.

Additions to each index metadata: Indexes which are not encrypted remain unchanged. For encrypted indexes, the following is added: key key_metadata of type String, pointing to the label of the key used to encrypt the set of columns for this index. The set of columns for a specific is obtained by acquiring the Parquet schema tree, and taking all the paths to leaves which start with the Spark column name for this index (this is why the set of spark column names must be prefix free). for example, for a MinMax on temp , the set of columns we need to encrypt is {temp_minmax.metadata} Note that this key label must be consistent with the one with which the columns for this index are encrypted, as configured in the column key list string in the obj_name metadata. if they are inconsistent, then this is a bug in the lib. the column key list string is kept in the obj_name metadata to save unnecessary scans to re-create that config when refreshing/compacting. the key_metadata in each index is used e.g. when listing existing indexes (to be able to retrieve the keyMetadata field in the Index case class).

This abstraction operates in two main areas: Indexing Flow - abstract metadata is generated during index creation and refresh by analyzing a DataFrame.

Note For advanced details see the API section and the full API Reference . See here for sample notebooks. Setup Apache Spark with Xskipper \u00b6 Xskipper is compatible with Apache Spark 3.x, There are two ways to setup Xskipper: Run interactively: Start the Spark shell (Scala or Python) with Xskipper and explore Xskipper interactively. Run as a project: Set up a Maven or SBT project (Scala or Java) with Xskipper. Run with an interactive shell \u00b6 To use Xskipper interactively within the Spark\u2019s Scala/Python shell, you need a local installation of Apache Spark. Follow the instructions here to install Apache Spark. Spark Scala Shell \u00b6 Start a Spark Scala shell as follows: ./bin/spark-shell --packages io.xskipper:xskipper-core_2.12:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT PySpark \u00b6 Install or upgrade PySpark (3.2 or above) by running the following: pip install --upgrade pyspark Then, run PySpark with the Xskipper package: pyspark --packages io.xskipper:xskipper-core_2.12:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT Run as a project \u00b6 To build a project using the Xskipper binaries from the Maven Central Repository, use the following Maven coordinates: Maven \u00b6 Include Xskipper in a Maven project by adding it as a dependency in the project's POM file. Xskipper should be compiled with Scala 2.12. <dependency> <groupId> io.xskipper </groupId> <artifactId> xskipper-core_2.12 </artifactId> <version> 1.3.1-SNAPSHOT </version> </dependency> SBT \u00b6 Include Xskipper in an SBT project by adding the following line to its build.sbt file: libraryDependencies += \"io.xskipper\" %% \"xskipper-core\" % \"1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\" Python \u00b6 To set up a Python project, first start the Spark session using the Xskipper package and then import the Python APIs. spark = pyspark . sql . SparkSession . builder . appName ( \"Xskipper\" ) \\ . config ( \"spark.jars.packages\" , \"io.xskipper:xskipper-core_2.12:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT\" ) \\ . getOrCreate () from xskipper import Xskipper from xskipper import Registration Configure Xskipper \u00b6 In this example, we configure a JVM wide parameter to a base path which stores all data skipping indexes. The indexes can be stored on the same storage system as the data, but not under the same path. During query time indexes will be consulted at this location. For more configuration options, see configuration options . Python Scala from xskipper import Xskipper # The base location to store all indexes # TODO: change to your index base location md_base_location = \"/tmp/metadata\" # Configuring the JVM wide parameters conf = dict ([ ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation\" , md_base_location ), ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type\" , \"EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION\" ), ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.filter.dedup\" , \"false\" )]) Xskipper . setConf ( spark , conf ) import io . xskipper . _ import io . xskipper . implicits . _ // The base location to store all indexes // TODO: change to your index base location val md_base_location = s\"/tmp/metadata\" // Configuring the JVM wide parameters val conf = Map ( \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation\" -> md_base_location , \"io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation.type\" -> \"EXPLICIT_BASE_PATH_LOCATION\" , \"io.xskipper.parquet.filter.dedup\" -> \"false\" ) Xskipper . setConf ( conf ) Indexing a Dataset \u00b6 Creating a Sample Dataset \u00b6 First, let's create a sample dataset. Python Scala from pyspark.sql.types import * # TODO: change to your data location dataset_location = \"/tmp/data\" df_schema = StructType ([ StructField ( \"dt\" , StringType (), True ), StructField ( \"temp\" , DoubleType (), True ), \\ StructField ( \"city\" , StringType (), True ), StructField ( \"vid\" , StringType (), True )]) data = [( \"2017-07-07\" , 20.0 , \"Tel-Aviv\" , \"a\" ), ( \"2017-07-08\" , 30.0 , \"Jerusalem\" , \"b\" )] df = spark . createDataFrame ( data , schema = df_schema ) # use partitionBy to make sure we have two objects df . write . partitionBy ( \"dt\" ) . mode ( \"overwrite\" ) . parquet ( dataset_location ) # read the dataset back from storage reader = spark . read . format ( \"parquet\" ) df = reader . load ( dataset_location ) df . show ( 10 , False ) import org . apache . spark . sql . Row import org . apache . spark . sql . types .{ DoubleType , StringType , StructField , StructType } // TODO: change to your data location val dataset_location = s\"/tmp/data\" val schema = List ( StructField ( \"dt\" , StringType , true ), StructField ( \"temp\" , DoubleType , true ), StructField ( \"city\" , StringType , true ), StructField ( \"vid\" , StringType , true ) ) val data = Seq ( Row ( \"2017-07-07\" , 20.0 , \"Tel-Aviv\" , \"a\" ), Row ( \"2017-07-08\" , 30.0 , \"Jerusalem\" , \"b\" ) ) val ds = spark . createDataFrame ( spark . sparkContext . parallelize ( data ), StructType ( schema ) ) // use partitionBy to make sure we have two objects ds . write . partitionBy ( \"dt\" ). mode ( \"overwrite\" ). parquet ( dataset_location ) // read the dataset back from storage val reader = spark . read . format ( \"parquet\" ) val df = reader . load ( dataset_location ) df . show ( false ) Indexing \u00b6 When creating a data skipping index on a data set, first decide which columns to index, then choose an index type for each column. These choices are workload and data dependent. Typically, choose columns to which predicates are applied in many queries. The following index types are supported out of the box: Index type Description Applicable to predicates in WHERE clauses Column types MinMax Stores minimum and maximum values for a column <,<=,=,>=,> All types except for complex types. See Supported Spark SQL data types . ValueList Stores the list of unique values for the column =,IN,LIKE All types except for complex types. See Supported Spark SQL data types . BloomFilter Uses a bloom filter to test for set membership =,IN Byte, String, Long, Integer, Short MinMax results in small index size and is a good usually choice when the dataset's sort order is correlated with a given column. For the other 2 options, choose value list if the number of distinct values in an object is typically much smaller than the total number of values in that object. On the other hand Bloom filters are recommended for columns with high cardinality (otherwise the index can get as big as that column of the data set). Note that Xskipper also enables to create your own data skipping indexes and specify how to use them during query time. For more details see here . Python Scala # create Xskipper instance for the sample dataset xskipper = Xskipper ( spark , dataset_location ) # remove index if exists if xskipper . isIndexed (): xskipper . dropIndex () xskipper . indexBuilder () \\ . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" ) \\ . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) \\ . addBloomFilterIndex ( \"vid\" ) \\ . build ( reader ) \\ . show ( 10 , False ) // create Xskipper instance for the sample dataset val xskipper = new Xskipper ( spark , dataset_location ) // remove existing index if needed if ( xskipper . isIndexed ()) { xskipper . dropIndex () } xskipper . indexBuilder () . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" ) . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) . addBloomFilterIndex ( \"vid\" ) . build ( reader ) . show ( false ) Viewing index status \u00b6 The following code shows how a user can view the current index status to check which indexes exist on the dataset and whether the index is up-to-date. Python Scala xskipper . describeIndex ( reader ) . show ( 10 , False ) xskipper . describeIndex ( reader ). show ( false ) List Indexed datasets \u00b6 The following code shows how a user can view all indexed datasets under the current base location. Python Scala Xskipper . listIndexes ( spark ) . show ( 10 , False ) Xskipper . listIndexes ( spark ). show ( false ) Using Data Skipping Indexes \u00b6 Enable/Disable Xskipper \u00b6 Xskipper provides APIs to enable or disable index usage with Spark. By using the \"enable\" command, Xskipper optimization rules become visible to the Apache Spark optimizer and will be used in query optimization and execution. By using the \"disable' command, Xskipper optimization rules no longer apply during query optimization. Note that disabling Xskipper has no impact on created indexes, and they remain intact. Python Scala # Enable Xskipper Xskipper . enable ( spark ) # Disable Xskipper Xskipper . disable ( spark ) # You can use the following to check whether the Xskipper is enabled if not Xskipper . isEnabled ( spark ): Xskipper . enable ( spark ) // Enable Xskipper spark . enableXskipper () // Disable Xskipper spark . disableXskipper () // You can use the following to check whether the Xskipper is enabled if ( ! spark . isXskipperEnabled ()) { spark . enableXskipper () } Xskipper also provides an API to inject the DataSkippingFileIndexRule into catalyst as part of the operatorOptimization rules and enable it using spark session extensions injectOptimizerRule. By adding io.xskipper.utils.RuleExtension to spark.sql.extensions Xskipper optimization rules become visible to the Apache Spark optimizer and will be used in query optimization and execution. To use with thrift server, start the thrift server with the extension: start-thriftserver.sh --jars <XskipperJar> --conf spark.sql.extensions = io.xskipper.RuleExtension --conf spark.sql.extensions = io.xskipper.utils.RuleExtension Alternatively, instead of --jars use --packages <io.xskipper:xskipper-core release> Running Queries \u00b6 Once Xskipper has been enabled you can run queries (using either SQL or the DataFrame API) and enjoy the performance and cost benefits of data skipping. There will be no change to query results. First, let's create a temporary view: Python Scala df = reader . load ( dataset_location ) df . createOrReplaceTempView ( \"sample\" ) df . createOrReplaceTempView ( \"sample\" ) Example query using the MinMax index \u00b6 Python Scala spark . sql ( \"select * from sample where temp < 30\" ) . show () spark . sql ( \"select * from sample where temp < 30\" ). show () Inspecting query skipping stats \u00b6 Note Starting from version 1.3.0, skipping stats are disabled for queries involving Data Source V2 file sources. note that after processing a query that involves Data Source v2 file sources, stats are disabled for all subsequent queries until the stats are cleared. See this issue Python Scala Xskipper . getLatestQueryAggregatedStats ( spark ) . show ( 10 , False ) Xskipper . getLatestQueryAggregatedStats ( spark ). show ( false ) Note: the above returns the accumulated data skipping statistics for all of the datasets which were involved in the query. If you want to inspect the stats for a specific dataset you can call the API below to get stats on the Xskipper instance: Python Scala xskipper . getLatestQueryStats () . show ( 10 , False ) xskipper . getLatestQueryStats (). show ( false ) For more examples see the sample notebooks Index Life Cycle \u00b6 The following operations can be used in order to maintain the index. Refresh Index \u00b6 Over time the index can become stale as new files are added/removed/modified from the dataset. In order to bring the index up-to-date you can call the refresh operation which will index the new/modified files and remove obsolete metadata. Note: The index will still be beneficial for files which didn't change since the last indexing time even without refreshing. First let's simulate addition of new data to the dataset: Python Scala # adding new file to the dataset to simulate changes in the dataset update_data = [( \"2017-07-09\" , 25.0 , \"Beer-Sheva\" , \"c\" )] update_df = spark . createDataFrame ( update_data , schema = df_schema ) # append to the existing dataset update_df . write . partitionBy ( \"dt\" ) . mode ( \"append\" ) . parquet ( dataset_location ) val update_data = Seq ( Row ( \"2017-07-09\" , 25.0 , \"Beer-Sheva\" , \"c\" ) ) val update_ds = spark . createDataFrame ( spark . sparkContext . parallelize ( update_data ), StructType ( schema ) ) // append to the existing dataset update_ds . write . partitionBy ( \"dt\" ). mode ( \"append\" ). parquet ( dataset_location ) Now, let's inspect the index status: Python Scala xskipper . describeIndex ( reader ) . show ( 10 , False ) xskipper . describeIndex ( reader ). show ( false ) In this case the index status will indicate that there are new files that are not indexed. Therefore we use the Refresh operation to update the metadata: Python Scala xskipper . refreshIndex ( reader ) . show ( 10 , False ) xskipper . refreshIndex ( reader ). show ( false ) Now you can run the describe operation again and see that the metadata is up to date. Drop Index \u00b6 In order to drop the index use the following API call: Python Scala xskipper . dropIndex () xskipper . dropIndex () Working with Hive tables \u00b6 Xskipper also supports skipping over hive tables. Note that indexing is for Hive tables with partitions. To index tables without partitions, index the physical location directly. The API for working with hive tables is similar to the API presented above with 2 main differences: The uri used in the Xskipper constructor is the table identifier with the form: <db>.<table> . The API calls do not require a DataFrameReader. For more information regarding the API see here . The index location for a hive table is resolved according to the following: If the table contains the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation this value will be used as the index location. Otherwise, xskipper will look up the parameter io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation in the table's database and will use it as the base index location for all tables. Note: During indexing, the index location parameter can be automatically added to the table properties if the xskipper instance is configured accordingly. For more info regarding the index location configuration see here . Setting the base index location in the database \u00b6 In this example we will set the base location in the database. Python Scala alter_db_ddl = ( \"ALTER DATABASE default SET DBPROPERTIES ('io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation'=' {0} ')\" ) . format ( md_base_location ) spark . sql ( alter_db_ddl ) val alter_db_ddl = s\"ALTER DATABASE default SET DBPROPERTIES ('io.xskipper.parquet.mdlocation'=' ${ md_base_location } ')\" spark . sql ( alter_db_ddl ) Creating a Sample Hive Table \u00b6 Let's create a hive table on the dataset we created earlier: Python Scala create_table_ddl = \"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tbl ( \\ temp Double, city String, vid String, dt String ) USING PARQUET PARTITIONED BY (dt) LOCATION ' {0} '\"\"\" . format ( dataset_location ) spark . sql ( create_table_ddl ) # recover the partitions spark . sql ( \"ALTER TABLE tbl RECOVER PARTITIONS\" ) # verify the table was created spark . sql ( \"show tables\" ) . show ( 10 , False ) spark . sql ( \"show partitions tbl\" ) . show ( 10 , False ) val create_table_ddl = s\"\"\"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tbl ( |temp Double, |city String, |vid String, |dt String |) |USING PARQUET |PARTITIONED BY (dt) |LOCATION ' ${ dataset_location } ' |\"\"\" . stripMargin spark . sql ( create_table_ddl ) // Recover the table partitions spark . sql ( \"ALTER TABLE tbl RECOVER PARTITIONS\" ) // verify the table was created spark . sql ( \"show tables\" ). show ( false ) spark . sql ( \"show partitions tbl\" ). show ( false ) Indexing a Hive Table \u00b6 Note we use default.sample as the uri in the Xskipper constructor. Python Scala # create an Xskipper instance for the sample Hive Table xskipper_hive = Xskipper ( spark , 'default.tbl' ) # remove index if exists if xskipper_hive . isIndexed (): xskipper_hive . dropIndex () xskipper_hive . indexBuilder () \\ . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" ) \\ . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) \\ . addBloomFilterIndex ( \"vid\" ) \\ . build () \\ . show ( 10 , False ) // create an Xskipper instance for the sample Hive Table val xskipper_hive = new Xskipper ( spark , \"default.tbl\" ) // remove existing index if needed if ( xskipper_hive . isIndexed ()) { xskipper_hive . dropIndex () } xskipper_hive . indexBuilder () . addMinMaxIndex ( \"temp\" ) . addValueListIndex ( \"city\" ) . addBloomFilterIndex ( \"vid\" ) . build () . show ( false ) Running Queries \u00b6 Once Xskipper has been enabled you can continue running queries (using either SQL or DataFrame API) and enjoy the benefits of data skipping. First, let's make sure Xskipper is enabled: Python Scala # You can use the following to check whether the Xskipper is enabled if not Xskipper . isEnabled ( spark ): Xskipper . enable ( spark ) // You can use the following to check whether the Xskipper is enabled if ( ! spark . isXskipperEnabled ()) { spark . enableXskipper () } Example query using the MinMax index \u00b6 Python Scala spark . sql ( \"select * from tbl where temp < 30\" ) . show ( false ) spark . sql ( \"select * from tbl where temp < 30\" ). show ( false ) Inspecting the query stats: Python Scala Xskipper . getLatestQueryAggregatedStats ( spark ) . show ( 10 , False ) Xskipper . getLatestQueryAggregatedStats ( spark ). show ( false ) Index Life Cycle - Hive Tables \u00b6 The API is similar to the dataset API but without the need for a reader instance.

The following index types are supported out of the box: Index type Description Applicable to predicates in WHERE clauses Column types MinMax Stores minimum and maximum values for a column <,<=,=,>=,> All types except for complex types. See Supported Spark SQL data types . ValueList Stores the list of unique values for the column =,IN,LIKE All types except for complex types. See Supported Spark SQL data types . BloomFilter Uses a bloom filter to test for set membership =,IN Byte, String, Long, Integer, Short MinMax results in small index size and is a good usually choice when the dataset's sort order is correlated with a given column. For the other 2 options, choose value list if the number of distinct values in an object is typically much smaller than the total number of values in that object. On the other hand Bloom filters are recommended for columns with high cardinality (otherwise the index can get as big as that column of the data set).
