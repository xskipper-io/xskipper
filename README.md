![Build Status](https://github.com/xskipper-io/xskipper/workflows/build/badge.svg)

Xskipper is an Extensible Data Skipping Framework for [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

To get started, see the [Quick Start Guide](https://xskipper.io/getting-started/quick-start-guide/) .

See Xskipper [site](https://xskipper.io) for more info. 

# Run as a project

To build a project using the Xskipper binaries from the Maven Central Repository, use the following Maven coordinates:

## Maven

Include Xskipper in a Maven project by adding it as a dependency in the project's POM file. Xskipper should be compiled with Scala 2.12.

```XML
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.xskipper</groupId>
  <artifactId>xskipper-core_2.12</artifactId>
  <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## SBT
Include Xskipper in an SBT project by adding the following line to its build.sbt file:

```Scala
libraryDependencies += "io.xskipper" %% "xskipper-core" % "1.3.0"
```

# Building

Xskipper is compiled using [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Command-Line-Reference.html).

To compile, run

    build/sbt compile

To generate artifacts, run

    build/sbt package

To execute tests, run

    build/sbt test

Refer to [SBT docs](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Command-Line-Reference.html) for more commands.
